## MySQL Variables

This repository provides resources and examples for understanding and using variables effectively in MySQL.

## What are MySQL Variables?

MySQL variables serve as temporary named storage locations within a session or connection. They are valuable for:

* Holding intermediate values during calculations.
* Simplifying complex queries.
* Storing temporary data within a session.

## Types of Variables

MySQL offers three primary types of variables:

```
### Local Variables (@variables)
```

These variables are specific to the current connection and cannot be accessed from other sessions. They are ideal for temporary calculations and data manipulation within the current session.

```
### Session Variables (@@variables)
```

These variables have a broader scope, shared across all connections within the same session. They are useful for configuration settings that apply to the entire session, such as timeouts or character encoding.

```
### Global Variables (@@global.variables)
```

These variables have the most extensive scope, affecting all sessions on the MySQL server. Modify them with caution, as unintended side effects can impact all user sessions.

## Declaring Variables

Before using a variable, declare it with the `DECLARE` statement, specifying its name and data type:

```sql
DECLARE variable_name data_type;
```

Choose a data type that aligns with the values you intend to store in the variable. Common data types include:

* `INT`: Integers (whole numbers)
* `DECIMAL`: Numbers with decimal points
* `CHAR`: Fixed-length character strings
* `VARCHAR`: Variable-length character strings
* `DATE`: Date values
* `DATETIME`: Date and time values

## Assigning Values

Once declared, use the `SET` statement to assign a value to the variable:

```sql
SET variable_name = value;
```

The value can be a literal value, an expression, or the result of another query.

## Using Variables in Queries

Incorporate variables into your MySQL queries for enhanced flexibility and dynamic behavior:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = @customer_id;

SET @total_sales = (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders);
```

## Examples

This repository includes examples illustrating various applications of MySQL variables:

* **Calculating totals and averages**
* **Simplifying complex conditions with conditional statements**
* **Storing temporary data for further processing**
* **Customizing query behavior based on variable values**
